## 3.9.System Performance Analysis

System performance analysis involves evaluating and analyzing the performance of a system under different loads and scenarios to identify bottlenecks and improvement areas, ensuring system availability and stability.

The performance of this system is as follows:

### 3.9.1.Response Time

System response time refers to the time taken for a user to receive a response from the system after sending a request. The response time needs to be within an acceptable range to avoid impacting user experience and shopping experience. When designing and implementing the system, it is necessary to optimize the system's algorithms and data structures to reduce response time and improve system performance.

The response time for this system should be between 1-3 seconds.

### 3.9.2.Concurrent Performance

Concurrent performance refers to how well the system performs when multiple users access it simultaneously. The system needs to support multiple users accessing it concurrently while ensuring stability and availability. When designing and implementing the system, concurrent performance needs to be considered, and the system should undergo stress testing and load testing to determine the maximum concurrency and identify any bottlenecks.

This system can handle thousands of concurrent users while maintaining stability and availability.

## 3.9.3.Scalability

Scalability of the system refers to its ability to maintain stability and availability when facing business growth and user growth. Horizontal scaling can be achieved by adding more servers to increase the system's load capacity, while vertical scaling involves improving the server's configuration to enhance system performance.

This system supports horizontal and vertical scalability, allowing for dynamic scaling up and down.

### 3.9.4.Reliability

Reliability of the system refers to its ability to handle and recover from exceptions and errors without compromising stability and availability. When designing and implementing the system, reliability needs to be considered, and the system should support fault tolerance and error handling.

This system has a reliability of 99.99%, meaning the system's downtime should not exceed 5 minutes per year.

### 3.9.5.Security

Security of the system refers to its ability to safeguard data and user privacy in the face of attacks and malicious behavior. When designing and implementing the system, security needs to be considered, and the system should support security measures such as authentication, data encryption, and access control.

This system supports data encryption, authentication, access control, and other security measures to ensure system security.
