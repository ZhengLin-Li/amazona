(7) Architecture Design:

Use RESTful API to implement the interfaces of the microservice, supporting HTTP protocol and JSON data format, facilitating interaction between client applications and the service.

Use a NoSQL database (such as MongoDB) to store cart information for high performance and scalability.

Containerize the microservice using containerization technologies (such as Docker) to achieve deployment flexibility and portability.

(8) Error Handling:

When a cart operation fails, return appropriate error information, including error codes and descriptions, to allow the client to handle errors correctly.

Use logging techniques to record and monitor errors and exceptions at runtime, facilitating troubleshooting and issue resolution by operations personnel.
