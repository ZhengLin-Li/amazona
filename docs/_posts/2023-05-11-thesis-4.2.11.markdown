### 4.2.11.Logistics Query Service

(1) Service Name: Logistics Query Service

(2) Functionality: This microservice provides a logistics information query service for orders. It includes querying the delivery status, logistics company, waybill number, and other related information of an order, and returns the query result.

(3) Query Logistics Information Interface Definition (Query Logistics Info):

Input Parameters:

Order ID (orderId): A string representing the ID of the order for which logistics information is to be queried.

Output Parameters:

Query Result (result): A boolean value indicating whether the query operation was successful.

Error Message (error): A string representing the error message in case of query failure.

(4) Architecture Design:

Use lightweight RESTful API for service design and communicate using the HTTP protocol.

Microservice gateway (API Gateway) can be used for API management and traffic control to improve service availability and security.

Cache technology (e.g., Redis) can be used to cache query results, enhancing query efficiency and response speed.

(5) Error Handling:

When a query request fails, return appropriate error information, including error codes and descriptions, to enable clients to handle error scenarios correctly.

Use logging technology to record and monitor runtime errors and exceptions of the service, facilitating troubleshooting and issue localization by operations personnel.
