### 4.2.14.Review Submit Service

(1) Service Name: Review Submit Service

(2) Functionality: This microservice is responsible for handling the submission of product reviews from client applications. It includes storing the review information in the review database and notifying other relevant services to update the product review information.

(3) Submit Review Interface Definition (Submit Review):

Input Parameters:

Product ID (productId): A string representing the unique ID of the product.

User ID (userId): A string representing the unique ID of the user.

Rating (rating): An integer representing the rating given by the user for the product.

Comment (comment): A string representing the comment provided by the user for the product.

Output Parameters:

Review ID (reviewId): A string representing the unique ID of the review.

Review Submission Result (result): A boolean value indicating whether the review operation was successful.

Error Information (error): A string representing the error information in case of a failed review submission.

(4) Architecture Design:

It follows a RESTful architecture design pattern where client applications can send review requests to the Review Submit Service using the HTTP protocol and receive the review submission result from the server.

The Review Submit Service needs to communicate with other relevant services, including the Product Details Service and the Review Query Service. It can use RESTful APIs to send requests to these services and return the response results to the client applications.

Containerization technology such as Docker can be used to containerize the microservice, providing flexibility and portability in deployment.

(5) Error Handling:

When a review submission request fails, appropriate error information, including error codes and descriptions, should be returned to enable clients to handle error scenarios correctly.

Logging technology should be used to record and monitor runtime errors and exceptions of the service, facilitating troubleshooting and issue localization by operations personnel.
