## 3.4.System Requirements Analysis - Maintainability Requirements

A project with good maintainability can reduce maintenance costs, improve code quality, and scalability, enabling developers to efficiently maintain and upgrade the system. The following are the maintainability advantages of the MERN technology stack and its practices in this project:

Code structure and standards: Both the frontend and backend in the MERN technology stack can be organized using a modular approach, with standardized naming conventions, comments, and coding styles, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Componentization: React in the MERN technology stack supports component-based development, allowing separation of UI and logic, reducing code coupling, promoting code reuse, minimizing code redundancy, and improving system maintainability.

Unified state management: Redux in the MERN technology stack provides a centralized state management solution, extracting the state from components, reducing coupling between components, enabling state sharing and management across the entire application, enhancing system maintainability.

Unit and integration testing: Testing tools like Jest and Enzyme in the MERN technology stack support unit testing and integration testing. These tools facilitate automated testing and verification of code correctness and stability, ensuring code quality and maintainability.

Code refactoring and optimization: For long-term maintenance projects, code refactoring and optimization are effective means to improve maintainability. The MERN technology stack offers tools and libraries that help developers quickly identify and optimize issues, such as using Chrome DevTools for performance optimization and ESLint for code style checks.

Documentation and comments: The MERN technology stack provides rich documentation and comment support. For example, using JSDoc to generate API documentation and Storybook to generate UI component documentation. These tools assist developers in better understanding and maintaining the code.
