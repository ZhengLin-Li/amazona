## 5.3.Chapter Summary

This chapter presented the implementation of an e-commerce system using the microservices architecture. When developing an e-commerce system, it is essential to consider various choices of environments and tools. In Section 5.1, this chapter provided a brief overview of these environments and tools. Specifically, the chapter discussed operating systems, IDEs, frontend package management tools, databases, testing support, and deployment environments. The selection of these tools and environments is crucial for developers as it greatly improves development efficiency and code quality.

Next, in Section 5.2, the chapter provided detailed explanations of the implementation of the system's user interfaces. It covered various interfaces including user registration, user login, user profile, product display, product details, product search, shopping cart, order management, product review viewing, and product review writing interfaces. These interfaces are integral components of an e-commerce system, and readers can gain an understanding of their implementation through this chapter, thereby enhancing their comprehension of the operation and design principles of an e-commerce system.

Finally, Section 5.3 provided a summary of the chapter. By studying this chapter, readers gained knowledge on implementing an e-commerce system using the microservices architecture and learned about various interface implementation approaches. The knowledge gained from this chapter serves as a reference and guide for readers' future e-commerce system development, aiding them in better understanding the design principles and implementation approaches of the microservices architecture.
