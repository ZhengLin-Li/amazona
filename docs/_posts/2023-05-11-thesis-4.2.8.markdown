(6) Architecture Design:

Adopt a distributed architecture by splitting the order service into multiple sub-services, including order creation service, order cancellation service, order query service, etc., to improve performance and scalability.

Use the RESTful API design pattern to provide the order service to client applications and use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure authentication and authorization management.

Utilize message queues (such as Kafka) to publish order status update events to other services, ensuring proper handling of order status and facilitating coordination and communication with other services.

(7) Error Handling:

Return appropriate error information, including error codes and error descriptions, when order requests fail, enabling clients to handle error scenarios correctly.

Employ logging technology to record and monitor runtime errors and exceptions of the service, facilitating troubleshooting and problem identification for operations personnel.
