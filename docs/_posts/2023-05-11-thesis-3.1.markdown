# 3.Microservices E-commerce System Requirements Analysis

In the development of software systems, system analysis and design is a crucial phase. Its main purpose is to understand user requirements, design the structure and functionality of the system, and plan the resources and time required to implement the system.

The process of system analysis and design includes multiple stages such as requirement analysis, high-level design, and detailed design. Among them, requirement analysis refers to the detailed investigation and analysis of user requirements in order to clarify the system's functional and performance requirements. High-level design is based on the requirement analysis, where the overall structure of the system is designed and planned to meet user needs and system performance requirements. Detailed design, on the other hand, involves detailed design and planning of various components of the system based on the high-level design to ensure system efficiency, stability, and reliability.

## 3.1.System Requirement Analysis - Functional Requirements

In software development, functional requirements are the functions or features that software or a system must implement in order to fulfill business objectives. These requirements describe the functionalities or tasks that the software must possess and are typically proposed by clients or users, and implemented by the development team throughout the software development process. In the early stages of the software development lifecycle, functional requirements often serve as a communication tool between the development team and the clients or users, helping the team understand the expectations and needs of the clients or users and translating them into specific achievable requirements.

For the microservices e-commerce system project described in this document, the following are the functional requirements:
