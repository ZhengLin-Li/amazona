### 4.2.3.User Information Service

(1) Service Name: User Information Service

(2) Function Description: This microservice provides user information such as username, email address, and order history. Other services can invoke this service to obtain information about users.

(3) Get User Information Interface Definition:

Input Parameters:

User ID (userId): String representing the ID of the user for retrieving user information.

Output Parameters:

Username: String representing the username of the user.

Email Address: String representing the email address of the user.

Order History: Array representing the order history of the user.

(4) Architecture Design:

Utilize a RESTful API design pattern to send requests for retrieving user information to the server using the HTTP protocol for request transmission and processing.

Store user information in a MongoDB database for persistent storage and efficient retrieval.

Use Redis as a cache store, with user information as the value and user ID as the key, to enable fast retrieval and caching of user information.

(5) Error Handling:

In case of a failed request to retrieve user information, return appropriate error information, including error codes and descriptions, to enable clients to handle error scenarios correctly.

Employ logging techniques to record and monitor runtime errors and exceptions, facilitating troubleshooting and issue localization by operations personnel.
