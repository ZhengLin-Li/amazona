### 4.2.12.Logistics Update Service

(1) Service Name: Logistics Update Service

(2) Functionality: This microservice is responsible for handling update requests for logistics information of an order. It involves receiving updates for logistics information, validating the information's validity, saving the updated information to the database, and returning the update result.

(3) Update Logistics Information Interface Definition (Update Logistics Information):

Input Parameters:

Order Number (orderNumber): A string representing the order number for which logistics information is to be updated.

Logistics Company (logisticsCompany): A string representing the name of the logistics company.

Tracking Number (trackingNumber): A string representing the tracking number.

Shipping Status (shippingStatus): An enumeration indicating the shipping status of the order (shipped, in transit, delivered, etc.).

Output Parameters:

Update Result (result): A boolean value indicating whether the update operation was successful.

Error Message (error): A string representing the error message in case of update failure.

(4) Architecture Design:

Use a design pattern based on RESTful API to send logistics update requests to this microservice and return the update result.

Containerization technology (e.g., Docker) can be used to containerize the microservice for flexibility and portability in deployment.

Use a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store the logistics information of orders and utilize ORM (e.g., Hibernate) for object-relational mapping.

(5) Error Handling:

When an update request fails, return appropriate error information, including error codes and descriptions, to enable clients to handle error scenarios correctly.

Utilize logging technology to record and monitor runtime errors and exceptions of the service, facilitating troubleshooting and issue localization by operations personnel.
