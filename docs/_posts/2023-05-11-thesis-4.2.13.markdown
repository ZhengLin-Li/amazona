(5) Architecture Design:

This service can use a relational database (e.g., MongoDB) to store product review information, and client applications can query the review information by calling the API.

To enhance service performance and scalability, caching technology (e.g., Redis) can be employed to cache product review information, avoiding the need to access the database for every query.

(6) Error Handling:

When a request to retrieve review information fails, the service should return appropriate error information, including error codes and descriptions, to enable clients to handle error scenarios correctly.

Logging technology should be used to record and monitor runtime errors and exceptions of the service, facilitating troubleshooting and issue localization by operations personnel.
