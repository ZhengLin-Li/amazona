4.2.10.Payment Callback Service

(1) Service Name: Payment Callback Service

(2) Functionality: This service is responsible for processing payment callback notifications from third-party payment providers. It will update the payment status of an order and notify the order service to update the order status.

(3) Process Payment Callback Interface:

l Input parameters:

Order ID (orderId): String representing the ID of the order to be updated.

Transaction ID from third-party payment provider (transactionId): String representing the transaction ID generated by the third-party payment provider.

Payment amount (amount): Float representing the amount paid.

Payment status (status): String representing the payment status, such as "success" or "failed".

Payment time (timestamp): Timestamp representing the time of payment.

l Output parameters:

Update result (result): Boolean indicating whether the order status was successfully updated.

Error message (error): String representing the error message when the order status update fails.

(4) Architecture Design:

Receive payment callback notifications from third-party payment providers using a RESTful API.

Update order status by calling the order service API.

Asynchronous processing can be implemented using message queues or event gateways to improve system performance and scalability.

(5) Error Handling:

When payment callback processing fails, return appropriate error information, including error code and description, so that third-party payment providers can handle error situations correctly.

Use logging technology to record and monitor errors and exceptions at runtime for fault diagnosis and issue resolution by operations personnel.
