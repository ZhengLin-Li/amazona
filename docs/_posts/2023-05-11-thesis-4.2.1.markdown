## 4.2.Detailed Microservice Design

### 4.2.1.User Registration Service

(1) Service Name: User Registration Service

(2) Function Description: This microservice is responsible for handling user registration requests, including receiving user input for registration information, validating the information's validity, storing user information in the database, and returning the registration result.

(3) Register User Interface Definition:

Input Parameters:

Username: String representing the user's username.

Password: String representing the user's password.

Email: String representing the user's email address.

Output Parameters:

User ID: String representing the unique user ID generated after successful registration.

Registration Result: Boolean indicating the success of the registration operation.

Error Message: String representing the error message in case of registration failure.

(4) Architecture Design:

Use an event-driven architecture (EDA) design pattern to publish user registration requests to a message queue for asynchronous processing, enhancing performance and scalability.

Utilize a message queue (e.g., NATS Streaming Server) for message publishing and subscription, ensuring reliable message delivery and processing.

Containerize the microservice using containerization technologies like Docker for flexible and portable deployment.

(5) Error Handling:
Provide appropriate error information, including error codes and descriptions, when registration requests fail, enabling clients to handle error scenarios correctly.

Employ logging techniques to record and monitor runtime errors and exceptions, facilitating troubleshooting and issue localization by operations personnel.
